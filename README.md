# How to ask a question?

## Before you ask a question.
Do your research! some questions have already been answered and you can save a lot of time by finding the answer yourself.

## Step 1 : Prepare your question

Don't overcomplicate your question, keep it concise but make it meaningfull enough for the reader so that he has enough information to be able to help you properly.

## Step 2 : Proofread your question

Pretend you're talking too a busy collegue, he doesn't have enough time. So make sure to check that your question you prepared is crystal clear and you give enough details so he knows what you're talking about.

## Step 3 : Ask in the right place

Look for the right community/place to ask your question. You won't get a good answer if you ask a question about coding in a cooking community so it's important that you know you're asking the right people.

## Step 4 : Be Patient

It can take some time before you get an answer so be patient. Don't expect to get an answer immediatly people could be busy or they might be preparing a lengthy answer for you. So KEEP CALM & RELAXXXXX

## Step 5 : Not all answers might be suitable

In case you have multiple answers ( especially when you ask a question online ) find the one that suits you the most and solves your problem completely.
